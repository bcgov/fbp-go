  # Description:
  #   Computes the Length to Breadth ratio of an elliptically shaped fire at
  #   elapsed time since ignition. Equations are from listed FCFDG (1992) and
  #   Wotton et. al. (2009), and are marked as such.
  #
  #   All variables names are laid out in the same manner as Forestry Canada 
  #   Fire Danger Group (FCFDG) (1992). Development and Structure of the 
  #   Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction System." Technical Report 
  #   ST-X-3, Forestry Canada, Ottawa, Ontario.
