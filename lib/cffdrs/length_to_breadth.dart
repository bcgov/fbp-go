  #   Computes the Length to Breadth ratio of an elliptically shaped fire.

  #   Wotton et. al. (2009).

  #   All variables names are laid out in the same manner as Forestry Canada 
  #   Fire Danger Group (FCFDG) (1992). Development and Structure of the 
  #   Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction System." Technical Report 
  #   ST-X-3, Forestry Canada, Ottawa, Ontario.
